<br> my achievement will surely reflect at the time when I was called upon by my authority school to participate in an inter school debate and quiz competition.</br>
<br> I was really timid because i did not have the courage to face the audience. But wih the help of God in my life, I was able overcome such outrageous courage.</br>
<br> it was a normal routine for me to stay behind after classes for the tutorial and encouragement for the competition.</br>
<br> the day had already come when I woke up as early as possible in the mid-night to practise somethings which I considered could be the challenge.</br>
<br> i was absolutely confident about this competition.</br>
<br> During the tutorial earlier, i picked the two words from the teacher which were COURAGEOUS and COMMITTMENT.</br>
<br> when i got to the venue, i was intimidated by the way the judges were looking like but with time i shrugged it off.</br>
<br> when it was my turn,i took the bull by its horn and when straight to the point. The jugdes were impressed with the way i composed myself.</br>
<br> At the end of the debates, the judges were full of my praises and eventually gave me my reward which was a gold medal and the cup for my school.</br>
<p> That is that about my Life Achievement.</p>
